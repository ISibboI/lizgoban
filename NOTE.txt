Note on design:

We try to avoid a confirmation dialog for any action and enable "undo"
of it instead.  UI is kept modeless as far as possible.  See "humane
interface" for these points
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface).

Preferences are also kept as small as possible because they make
debugging difficult.

Note on implementation:

Leelaz is wrapped as if it is a stateless analyzer for convenience.
The wrapped leelaz receives the history of moves from the beginning to
the current board state for every analysis.  Only the difference from
the previous call is sent to leelaz internally for efficiency.

Endstate estimation (by ihavnoid's version) tends to oscillate between
black and white turns.  So we use the average of recent two moves for
score estimation and an even number for the width of endstate diff.
These are not applied to Katago as its estimation seems more stable.

src/package.json exists only for backward compatibility to enable "npx
electron src".
