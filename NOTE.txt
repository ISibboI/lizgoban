Note on implementation:

JavaScript code knows nothing about the rule of Go (liberty, ko, ...).
It merely parses the output of "showboard" from leelaz.
It holds only move history for redo.
This history is also updated passively from "showboard"
because it cannot judge whether a move is legal by itself.

It repeats...
1. Send "time_left b 0 0" to leelaz for starting pondering
2. Wait for 1 sec
3. Send "showboard" for stopping pondering and get suggestions from leelaz
