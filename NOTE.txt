Note on implementation:

JavaScript code knows nothing about the rule of Go (liberty, ko, ...).
It merely parses the output of "showboard" from leelaz for simplicity.

Leelaz is wrapped as if it is a stateless analyzer for convenience.
The wrapped leelaz receives the history of moves from the beginning to
the current board state for every analysis.  Only the difference from
the previous call is sent to leelaz internally for efficiency.

LizGoban listens to the port 8848 to receive treePosition from Sabaki.
