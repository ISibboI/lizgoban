<h3>Suggested moves in the board</h3>

<ul>
 <li>color: winrate</li>
 <li>opacity: visits</li>
 <li>number: visits order</li>
</ul>

<p>
You see yellow (normal), orange (bad), and red (very bad) circles usually.
When the opponent plays a bad move, you will see cyan (very good) and
green (good) circles.
Small red circles are next candidates that are not searched yet.
</p>

<p>
Basic operations:
<ul>
 <li>mouse click: put a stone</li>
 <li>mouse hover on a suggested move: show the principal variation</li>
 <li>"z" key (keep holding down): hide suggestions<br>
     (show suggestions in some styles in "View" menu)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Minor operations:
<ul>
 <li>Shift + hover on a stone: hide the stones after the move</li>
 <li>Shift + click on a stone: go back to the move</li>
 <li>Shift + hover on an empty grid: show move numbers</li>
 <li>right-click on an empty grid: put the same color stone as the previous move</li>
 <li>click on a tagged stone: go back to the move</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When the best suggested move is different from the previously expected one,
they are marked as red and blue squares respectively
so that you can notice the change of Leela Zero's opinion.
Black/white corner of the square indicates the plan of black/white.
They also appear in displayed variations.
This is especially useful when you are watching
Leela Zero vs. Leela Zero with different network weights, e.g.
"Black expects an extension after 8 moves, but white is planning a cut!"
(See "Alternative weights for white" and "Self play" in "Tool" menu.)
</p>

<p>
You can also select "Lizzie style" in "View" menu
(top number = winrate, bottom number = visits).
</p>

<h3>Winrate bar</h3>

<ul>
 <li>black/white area: winrate of the current board</li>
 <li>green/red rectangle: change of winrate by the last move (green = good, red = bad)</li>
 <li>triangles: evaluations of suggested next moves (height = visits, size = prior probability, blue = next move)</li>
 <li>empty triangle of opposite direction: evaluation of the last move (before it was played)
 <li>gray number: visits of the best suggestion (= top of winrate bar)</li>
 <li>gray curves: trails of evaluations through the progress of the search process</li>
</ul>

Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate bar.
See also "Expand winrate bar" in "View" menu.
In the large winrate bar,
orange circles indicate recent visits (analysis efforts) of suggested moves,
slant orange lines indicate PUCT (analysis priorities)
(x-axis = PUCT, y-axis = predicted future position by current winrate + PUCT),
and horizontal orange lines indicate LCB (criterion for suggestion order).

<h3>Winrate graph</h3>

<ul>
 <li>green segment: good move (increase winrate)</li>
 <li>red segment: bad move (decrease winrate)</li>
 <li>yellow segment: unexpected good move that was missed by leela zero</li>
 <li>yellow vertical line: evaluation error (difference between evaluations of the move before/after it was played)</li>
 <li>brown vertical line at bottom: uncertainty of the best move</li>
</ul>
Click / drag on the graph to go to the corresponding move.
Push "x" key (keep holding down) to enlarge winrate graph.

<h3>Visits graph</h3>

Another graph of visits progress is shown small
at the right bottom corner of the window
in <a href="#layout">landscape layout</a>.
Select "double_boards" in "View" menu and push "x" key
to view it in full size.

<ul>
 <li>x-axis: total visits</li>
 <li>y-axis: visits of each suggested move</li>
 <li>dotted curve: next move</li>
 <li>thick segment: best move</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="TrialBoard">Trial board</a></h3>

A new board is created when you try to modify an existing game.
Light color of this board indicates that it is a "trial" board;
you can delete it quickly by <a href="#Boards">"q" key</a> (undelete: Ctrl+z).
Uncheck "trial board" in "Edit" menu to turn it to a normal board.
You can use "Ctrl + click" instead of "click" to play a move
in a new trial board.

<h3>Handicap stones</h3>

Handicap stones are not supported.
You can only imitate them by passes for white ("New handicap game" in "File" menu),
though black still owes komi 7.5.
For free placement,
right-click puts the same color stone as the previous move conveniently.

<h3>Play against (weakened) leela zero</h3>

<p>
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Click any point in your turn.</li>
 <li>Hit Enter key in leela zero's turn.<br>
      Or, hit "1", "2", ..., "9" key
      (1 = slightly weak move, 9 = very weak move).<br>
      Or, hit "0" key (play pass when there is enough margin of winrate).</li>
</ol>
Push "z" key (keep holding down) to peek suggestions.
</p>

<p>
As another handicap,
you can also play against leela zero with a random mixture of different network weights.
<ol>
 <li>Select "Raw board" in "View" menu.</li>
 <li>Select a weights file (ex. LZ38) from "Load network weights" in "File" menu.</li>
 <li>Select another weights file (ex. LZ157) from "Alternative weights for white" in "Tool" menu.</li>
</ol>
Then LZ157 is used normally for white if you hit Enter key.
But, if you hit "1" key, LZ38 is used instead for white with 10% probability.
It is 20% by "2" key, 30% by "3" key, ..., and 90% by "9" key.
</p>

<h3><a name="layout">UI layout</a></h3>

You can switch landscape / portrait layout by changing window size.
(Portrait may be preferable when it is attached to Sabaki.)
See also "View" menu in LizGoban.

<h3><a name="letmethink">(Experimental) Let-me-think-first mode</a></h3>

If you select "Let me think first" in "View" menu,
LizGoban shows the plain board from 0% to 50% progress
and suggestions from 50% to 100%
for "Auto replay" or "Self play" in "Tool" menu.
Use <a href="#Tab">Tab key</a> to switch the view style manually.
Hit <a href="#semicolon">";" key</a> repeatedly to imitate
let-me-think-first style without autoplay.

<!--
<h3>Backward scan in auto-analysis</h3>

There is a
<span class="ext" onclick="open_ext('https://github.com/kaorahi/leela-zero/tree/ladder_revtrans')">modified Leela Zero</span>
that do not forget promising moves after undo.
Replace leelaz with it and
set auto analysis visits as a negative value for backward analysis
(scan from the last move to the first move)
to get possibly better evaluations when some moves are in "blind spots" of Leela Zero.
